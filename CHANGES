3.2.7 - Fri Feb 14, 1997
  fixes from Jeff Semke, PSC
    fixed bug in output.c that make it fail on some machines
    added FDDI support (untested by me, don't have FDDI)
    added Makefile flags so that it will compile on a "NetBSD 1.2 on a
	Pentium box"  (also untested by me, I don't have one)
  an HP compiler picked out some places where I missed a static
    decl for some functions.  Not fatal, but I fixed it.
