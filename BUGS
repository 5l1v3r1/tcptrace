Known Bugs

------------------------------------------------------------

Wed May 13, 1998

when file http.epeek.gz is run under solaris, the 14th packet comes up
with a bogus length.  When the file is NOT compressed, it works fine.
When the file is run under FreeBSD, compressed or not, it works fine.

Very strange...

Probably others... :-)
