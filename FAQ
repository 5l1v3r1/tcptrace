Probably.  It appears that you're doing the "packet grabbing" on the
same machine that's hosting the connection.  That's a problem under
SunOS.  Their packet capturing pseudo-device can't grab both ends of a 
connection whose home is the local machine.  I never can remember
which end it omits, but given your output, it appears that it can't
see packets SENT by the local host.  The easiest solution is to run
tcpdump on a machine OTHER than the ones you're monitoring.
