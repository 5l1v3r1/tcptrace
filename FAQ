Probably.  It appears that you're doing the "packet grabbing" on the
same machine that's hosting the connection.  That's a problem under
SunOS.  Their packet capturing pseudo-device can't grab both ends of a 
connection whose home is the local machine.  I never can remember
which end it omits, but given your output, it appears that it can't
see packets SENT by the local host.  The easiest solution is to run
tcpdump on a machine OTHER than the ones you're monitoring.

The "diamond" means that the segment was sent with a PUSH (so most
segments will have these except for large data transfers).  This feature
is now documented in the on-line docs.

Yes, this is a problem.  The only way to do it is to add invisible
points outside the normal range, xplot won't let me control the area
otherwise.  In this particular case, however, there's an easy
solution: use the middle mouse button to move the graph so that the
lower corner all shows.  Using this, you can scroll anywhere on the
screen, even outside the boundaries of the points being plotted.

I'm sorry, I don't keep up on Microsoft software.  Lots of people have
asked me this question and I don't know the answer.  I'm pretty sure
that tcpdump does NOT run under NT.  The only packet-grabbing software 
that I'm aware of for Wintel machines is etherpeek (Windows/NT/Mac):

It's nice software, but it's commercial.
