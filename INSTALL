OK, to the best of my knowledge, you should be able to get tcptrace to
compile and run under:

Solaris
NetBSD
FreeBSD
Linux
HPux

by making some simple changes to the Makefile (look for comments for
your target) and then just typing "make".  The program doesn't need to
be setuid or anything, so once you get the "tcptrace" binary, just
stuff it wherever you keep such things and you're all set!
